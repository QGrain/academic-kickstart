  Inverse problem in structures is to **rebuild** the physical situation of a **damaged structure** throught the collected data. This Smart City project covers the techniques of Finite Element Analysis and Deep Learning and is supervised by [Prof. Shaofan Li](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/li). In the summer research, we take cantilever as a research target.

  My responsibilities include:
  
  * Adopt FEA method to simulate the physical principles of cantilever.
  * Use tensorflow to build deep neural network and make prediction of the initial status of the cantilever.
  * Make temperature prediction of bridge based on **DSP methods** and machine learning. (Paper being prepared for Applied Science)
