  This is a national project aiming at the research of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems, which covers the techniques of Reverse Engineering, Netmap, **ATT&CK**, **Network Traffic Detection** and Deep Learning.

  My responsibilities include:
  
  * Propose a Fast Recoverable System for Cyber Range in order to conduct destructive experiments effciently. (Oral presentation on IEEE ICTC 2020)
  * Analyze the execution principles of malware based on reverse engineering | e.g. WannaCry would scan 445 port of the public IP and send payload by overflow of SMB I.
  * Based on the analysis of malware principles, leveraged the spatial and timing features to detect malicious traffc with pattern matching and deep learning | e.g. We managed to detect almost 100% nmap scan. (Submitted to Cybersecurity 2020)

  My responsibilities include:

  * Propose and implement an online NS-3 server with Vue, Nodejs and NS-3 engine, as the installation and conguration of NS-3 are complicated.
  * Provide tutorial pages and relevant experiment guidelines on the Web UI.
  * Adopt polling queue to improve the effciency of NS-3 compiling, effciency improved around 4x. (Submitted to SIMUtools 2020)

  Inverse problem in structures is to **rebuild** the physical situation of a **damaged structure** throught the collected data. This Smart City project covers the techniques of Finite Element Analysis and Deep Learning and is supervised by [Prof. Shaofan Li](https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/li). In the summer research, we take cantilever as a research target.

  My responsibilities include:
  
  * Adopt FEA method to simulate the physical principles of cantilever.
  * Use tensorflow to build deep neural network and make prediction of the initial status of the cantilever.
  * Make temperature prediction of bridge based on **DSP methods** and machine learning. (Paper being prepared for Applied Science)
